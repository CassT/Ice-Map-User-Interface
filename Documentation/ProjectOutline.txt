The overall goal of this project is to create a user-interface that allows researchers to query ice map data stored in a Virtuoso database.
The Current outline of this project is as follows:

1. Loading data into the Virtuoso database
	a. Convert single tarball ice data into RDF format
	   #Completed using the sigrid3rdf.py script - ShptoRdf
	b. Find a way to store this rdf data in the Virtuoso database - also effectively query the data using the web interface, or better yet the command line.
	c. Automate the above steps for all CIS data

2. Make simple SPARQL queries for ice data, test functionality.
	a. Test various queries using the browser interface and command line (SSH)
	b. keep testing...

3. Create a user-interface
	a. Create mockup of UI following guidelines detailed at Programmer's Wiki
	b. Translate UI searches into SPARQL queries - script/develop web application
	c. Make sure data is returned in format that makes sense

4. Extend application functionality as time permits
	a. Look into translating data from other data sources - will require in-depth knowledge of current ontology
	b. Program multiple return-formats for data
